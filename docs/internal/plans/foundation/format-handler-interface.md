# Plan: Format handler interface

The contract every format implements. Its real job is to make "add a format" a bounded unit of
work, because the experiment's headline measurement is whether format N+1 costs less than
format N, and that only means anything if the unit is the same each time.

## Context

Formats differ enormously at the protocol level (npm packuments, OCI manifest lists, PyPI simple
indexes, Galaxy import tasks) and barely at all underneath: they all resolve a name and version
to blobs, list what exists, accept uploads, and optionally fetch from an upstream and cache the
result.

The metadata schema is **not** this spec's concern: it belongs to
`docs/internal/plans/foundation/data-model.md`, which exists because leaving storage to each
handler would reproduce 31 bespoke schemas. A handler is protocol translation over a shared
model, and that split is what makes "add a format" a bounded unit of work.

Two constraints from the charter shape this:

- **Every format serves both a hosted path and a proxied path.** A format that only hosts is a
  format Gitea already does for free. The proxy path is the differentiator and cannot be
  retrofitted, because it changes what the handler is allowed to assume about where content
  comes from.
- **Handlers must not reach into each other.** Cross-format behavior belongs in storage, proxy
  or auth. This is a standing Go rule in `CLAUDE.md`, and it exists so that a format is
  independently implementable, testable and removable.

## Scope

**In scope**

- The handler interface: resolution, listing, upload, deletion, and upstream fetch.
- The registration mechanism that maps a URL prefix to a handler.
- The shared concerns handlers consume rather than implement: authentication, authorization,
  blob storage, the proxy cache, and request logging.
- The conformance obligations a handler must satisfy to be considered complete.

**Out of scope**

- Any individual format. Those are separate specs under `docs/internal/plans/formats/`.
- Virtual/aggregate repositories that merge several backing repositories. A later spec, though
  the interface should not preclude it.

## Design

### The shape

A handler is responsible only for **protocol translation**: turning its ecosystem's wire format
into calls against the shared layers, and back. It owns its routes, its metadata schema and its
content validation. It owns nothing else.

Concretely a handler:

- declares its route prefix and the requests it serves
- resolves a client request to a set of blob digests plus metadata
- validates and ingests an upload, returning digests for the shared store to commit
- renders its ecosystem's index/metadata documents from stored metadata
- for the proxied path, declares how to fetch from an upstream, what is cacheable, and for how
  long

It does **not** open object storage directly, implement its own auth check, manage its own
cache, or call another handler.

### Hosted and proxied are one handler, two paths

A single handler serves both, because the protocol is identical from the client's perspective;
only the source of truth differs. The handler declares, per request type, whether a miss may be
satisfied upstream and how the response is derived once it is.

This is also where the project's standing duplicated-path trap lives: a claim verified against
only the hosted path is not verified. Conformance cases are required in both modes
(`conformance-harness.md`, AC on mode coverage), and `CLAUDE.md` makes this a review rule.

### Definition of done for a format

A format is complete when, and only when:

1. Conformance cases pass in **both** modes, against at least two client versions.
2. Replay-match passes against a recorded corpus from a reference implementation.
3. No case is skipped without an issue number.
4. Its spec under `docs/internal/plans/formats/` records which parts of the ecosystem protocol
   are deliberately unimplemented, so the matrix does not imply coverage that does not exist.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: A format handler compiles and passes its conformance suite without any change to
      shared storage, auth or proxy code.
- [ ] AC2: No handler package imports another handler package, enforced by a lint rule or an
      architecture test rather than by review.
- [ ] AC3: No handler opens object storage or the database directly; all access is through the
      shared layers, enforced the same way.
- [ ] AC4: Every registered handler serves both a hosted and a proxied path, and the runner fails
      a format whose case set covers only one mode.
- [ ] AC5: Adding a format requires touching only its own package plus route registration,
      demonstrated by the generic and OCI handlers landing without shared-layer edits.

## Test Plan

| Criterion | Test Type | Test Location |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| AC1 | conformance | `conformance/<format>/` |
| AC2 | architecture test | `internal/format/arch_test.go` |
| AC3 | architecture test | `internal/format/arch_test.go` |
| AC4 | unit | `conformance/core/case_validate_test.go` |
| AC5 | manual | recorded in `docs/internal/tasks/experiment-log.md` per format |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Interface and registration
- Interface definition, route registration, architecture tests

### Phase 2: Proven by two
- Generic and OCI handlers, confirming the interface survives a trivial and a hard format

## Open Questions

None. Every question this spec raised has been answered by the owner and folded into
Design and Scope above, with each decision's accepted cost recorded beside it.

Resolved decisions are kept rather than deleted, so the reasoning survives the next time
someone asks why it was done this way.

### Resolved: handler API shape (was Q1)

**Settled 2026-09-22: HTTP directly.** Handlers receive the real request and response. These
are HTTP protocols with header and status semantics - OCI's `Range` and `Location`, npm's
conditional requests - and an abstraction hiding them would be fought by every format in turn.

Accepted cost: shared concerns (auth, storage access, cache policy) are enforceable only by
architecture tests and lint, never by the compiler. Those tests are therefore not optional
niceties; they are the only thing holding the boundary. This also confirms the extension boundary
stays in-process: an interface carrying `*http.Request` cannot be served over gRPC.

### Resolved: proxy path obligation (was Q2)

**Settled 2026-09-22: mandatory, with `generic` the single permitted exception.** The proxy
path is the differentiator; making it optional is how it becomes permanently second-class and the
product quietly becomes a slower Gitea.

`generic` may declare proxy support `unsupported` because it has no ecosystem to proxy, and that
exception is named in its own spec so the conformance matrix does not imply a gap that does not
exist. No other format may use it without a spec change.

### Resolved: extension boundary (was Q3)

**Settled 2026-09-22: compile-time Go modules.** Each format is a package implementing the shared
interface, compiled into one binary. This is what Gitea does for 22 formats and Harbor for 15
upstream adapters; **no dynamic plugin runtime is required for modularity**, which comes from a
uniform interface plus a shared data model instead.

Accepted cost: a third party cannot add a format without forking, and every format ships in every
binary. Out-of-process gRPC (`go-plugin`, as Terraform and Vault use) buys third-party
extensibility, and that is worth paying for only once a third party wants it.

### Resolved: upstream adapter axis (was Q4)

**Settled 2026-09-22: yes, a separate axis.** One format handler, many upstream adapters, as
Harbor does with 15 adapters behind one OCI format. Upstreams differ in authentication and
quirks, not in wire format.

Accepted cost: a second interface to design and maintain before it has a second implementation.
The alternative hard-codes Docker Hub's auth into the OCI handler and needs surgery for ECR,
which is the union-of-quirks trap avoided elsewhere in this spec.
