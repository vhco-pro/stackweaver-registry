# Plan: Content-addressable storage and GC

One blob layer, shared by every format, addressed only by digest. Plus the garbage collector,
which is the most dangerous component in the system.

## Context

Every format this project will implement reduces to the same primitive: immutable content blobs
plus mutable metadata pointing at them. Sharing one CAS across formats gives deduplication for
free, makes the proxy cache a natural extension rather than a parallel store, and means blob
durability is solved once.

**The reason this is a critical-priority spec is GC, not storage.** The charter names this as
the single most likely way the project eats data, and the reason is structural: the conformance
harness cannot see it. `docker push` returning 0 proves nothing about whether a concurrent GC
pass deleted a blob that push had just uploaded but not yet referenced. Every client-level test
can pass while the system is actively corrupting itself.

Known instances of this exact bug class in real registries: upload-then-reference races, GC
deleting blobs whose only reference is an in-flight manifest, and orphan accumulation from
interrupted chunked uploads that never get cleaned because the cleanup keys off a completed
upload record that was never written.

## Scope

**In scope**

- Content-addressable blob storage over S3-compatible object storage, keyed by digest.
- Chunked/resumable upload support, since OCI requires it and large artifacts need it.
- Reference counting or mark-and-sweep GC (see Open Questions).
- Orphan cleanup for interrupted uploads.
- Fault injection and property tests covering the races above.
- Throughput benchmarks wired to a CI regression gate.

**Out of scope**

- Replication between instances. Later, and it depends on decisions made here.
- Encryption at rest beyond what the object store provides.
- Per-format metadata storage. That is PostgreSQL and belongs to each handler.

## Design

### Addressing

A blob is keyed by its digest and nothing else. There is no path, no name, no format namespace
in the key. Two formats uploading identical content store one blob. **Never key a blob by
anything but its digest** - this is a standing Go rule in `CLAUDE.md` because a single
convenience exception destroys deduplication and makes GC unsound.

Metadata, which is mutable and format-specific, lives in PostgreSQL and references blobs by
digest. The object store holds no mutable state.

### Upload lifecycle

An upload moves through: session created, chunks received, digest verified on completion, blob
committed, reference recorded. The dangerous window is between *blob committed* and *reference
recorded*, because during it the blob is unreferenced and GC-eligible while being entirely
legitimate.

The design must make that window non-lethal. The candidate approaches are in Open Questions
because the choice constrains everything downstream.

### Garbage collection

GC deletes blobs no live metadata references. It must satisfy one invariant, stated as an
absolute:

> **GC never deletes a blob that is referenced, or that is about to be referenced by an upload
> in progress.**

The second clause is the hard half. A GC that only checks current references is correct only if
uploads are atomic with respect to it, and they are not.

### Testing what conformance cannot see

This is the part of the spec that exists because the harness is blind here. Required:

- **Property tests**: for randomised interleavings of push, pull, delete and GC, the invariant
  above holds.
- **Fault injection**: kill the server mid-upload, mid-commit and mid-GC, at each stage
  boundary; on restart the system is consistent and no referenced blob is missing.
- **Concurrency**: N concurrent pushes of overlapping blob sets, with GC running throughout.

A client-level conformance run is **not** evidence for any of these criteria, and a review that
accepts one as evidence has missed the point of the spec.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: A blob is retrievable by digest and only by digest; no API accepts a name or path as
      a blob key.
- [ ] AC2: Uploading identical content twice through two different formats results in exactly
      one stored object.
- [ ] AC3: A chunked upload interrupted at any stage boundary leaves no blob that GC will later
      treat as live, and no orphan that is never collected.
- [ ] AC4: GC never deletes a referenced blob, under randomised concurrent push/pull/delete/GC
      interleavings, proven by a property test.
- [ ] AC5: GC never deletes a blob belonging to an upload in progress, proven by a fault-injection
      test that runs GC during the commit-to-reference window specifically.
- [ ] AC6: Killing the process at any stage boundary leaves the store consistent on restart, with
      no referenced blob missing.
- [ ] AC7: Blob upload and download throughput are benchmarked, and CI fails on a regression
      beyond a stated threshold.

## Test Plan

| Criterion | Test Type | Test Location |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| AC1 | unit | `internal/storage/cas_test.go` |
| AC2 | integration | `internal/storage/dedup_test.go` |
| AC3 | fault injection | `internal/storage/upload_fault_test.go` |
| AC4 | property | `internal/storage/gc_property_test.go` |
| AC5 | fault injection | `internal/storage/gc_race_test.go` |
| AC6 | fault injection | `internal/storage/crash_recovery_test.go` |
| AC7 | benchmark | `internal/storage/bench_test.go` + CI gate |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: CAS
- Digest addressing, object store abstraction, simple upload

### Phase 2: Chunked upload
- Resumable sessions, digest verification, orphan records

### Phase 3: GC
- The chosen strategy, plus the property and fault-injection suites **written before it**

### Phase 4: Benchmarks
- Throughput benchmarks and the CI regression gate

## Open Questions

### Resolved: collection strategy (was Q1)

**Settled 2026-09-22: mark-and-sweep with a grace period.** What `distribution` converged on
after reference counting proved hard to keep correct across crashes. The grace period is what
neutralises the commit-to-reference window without distributed locking, which is the specific
race AC5 exists to police.

Accepted costs, recorded so they are not rediscovered as surprises: reclamation is delayed by the
grace period, and a full sweep is O(all blobs) and will need attention at scale. Revisit only
with a measured sweep-duration problem, not on principle.

Two reference classes, not one: per the shared data model (#12), a blob may be referenced by a
published file **or** by a cached file that arrived on demand. The sweep marks from both roots.
A sweep that marks only published references will delete live cache content.

### Q2: Does GC require a read-only or write-paused window?

**Recommendation:** no pause. A registry that stops accepting pushes to collect garbage is a
registry people route around, and the grace period exists precisely to avoid needing one.

**Why this is yours:** it is an operability-versus-implementation-simplicity call.

### Q3: Is PostgreSQL the metadata store, or is the object store self-describing?

**Recommendation:** PostgreSQL. Listing and consistency over an object store alone means
implementing an index anyway, badly.

**Why this is yours:** it sets the deployment floor. PostgreSQL means self-hosters run a
database, which is a real adoption cost for a project competing partly on being easy to run.
